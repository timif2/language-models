    "# Text Summarisation using Natural Language Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, there are two main approaches to automatic text summarisation: extraction and abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is the notion of generating a summary based on the text, with words in the summary that are not necessarily present in the text itself. This method however, can be too complex at times. Extraction therefore is more commonly used, and works by selecting certain words or sentences from the text, and creating summaries using them."
